				<p> Hello, you reached my Hobbies page. Some of the things I like to do include: </p>
					<ul>
					<li><b>Watching Movies and TV</b>: As a kid I always liked to watch moves as a hobby. One of the first ones I watched was Terminator II: Judgement Day
					The effects were great and the soundtrack got me engaged throughout the entire movie and that gave way to my film addiction today. Currently 
					this has evolved into a Netflix addiction due to my lack of self control when it comes to binging. Some of my favourite series so far include: The Wire
					The Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead.
					</li>
						
					<li><b>Playing Games</b>: I play a lot of games since i was a kid and one of my favourite genres is the MMO or "Massive Multiplayer Online". Generally these types of games sport a large player-base
					and within the game there are mechanics that let these players interact with each other in meaningful ways. By doing so i believe that the individual behind the avatar isn't just one person rather
					instead he is a person that is pursuing some sort of collective goal with other players. Currently the game I am playing with friends is known as "Black Desert Online".
					</li>
					
					<li><b>Chatting with Friends</b>: Weather it's in "IRL" or "In Game". I enjoy socializing with others. It is one of my greatest hobbies and often times i do it with the other ones
					seen above. I believe by connecting with other individuals you are sharing an experience and these experiences will fufill you as a person.
					
					</li>
				
					
					</ul>
