	My name is Aaron Zheng and thank you for visiting my page. Currently, I am 21 years old and an Intended Finance Major at the University of Georgia. 
	I have been here for two years now and thanks to this place I got to meet some interesting people and have some experiences I never dreamed of having. 
	This is a little bit about me.
	As a kid I grew up in Troy, Alabama and there I spent time doing things any kid would do: run around, play ball, and even explore at night.
	I attended a small elementary school called Troy Elementary and it was quite average in my opinion.
	I stayed there until around 4th Grade when I moved to Conyers, Georgia where I attended Shoal Creek Elementary. 
	There I discovered one of my hobbies which is playing games when I bought my first console and that followed me throughout life.

	In High School I was mainly an A student and a “somewhat” hard worker. For the most part I just showed up and the grade was there. I studied and took AP classes and thanks to those choices i am here.
	I always thought I was a “good” student until I came here to the University of Georgia. The classes were a challenge and i never thought there would be this many distractions.
	Here I learned I had to study and apply time management skills if I wanted to do better. I also had to plan out my day and make sure that i created a balanc between working and relaxing and thanks 
	to that i think i am doing better. However, to this day i am still learning.
